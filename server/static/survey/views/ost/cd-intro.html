<p>Contextual data may include consideration of the natural influences of the physical environment (e.g., oceanographic conditions or water quality), human influences (e.g., economic conditions or land-use patterns), and compliance (e.g., types and levels of compliance). These data are vital to understanding the natural and anthropogenic influences that shape Central Coast ecosystems. Weâ€™d like to know about any contextual data that are gathered as part of this project.</p>
