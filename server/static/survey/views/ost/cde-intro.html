<p>Contextual data may include consideration of the natural influences of the physical environment (e.g., oceanographic conditions or water quality), human influences (e.g., economic conditions or land-use patterns), and compliance (e.g., types and levels of compliance). These data are vital to understanding the natural and anthropogenic influences that shape Central Coast ecosystems. We’d like to know about any contextual data that are gathered as part of this project.</p>
