<p>We recognize that many ecological and human use monitoring projects also collect data on a range of natural and anthropogenic influences on ecosystems. This contextual data may include consideration of the natural influences of the physical environment (e.g., oceanographic conditions or water quality), human influences (e.g., economic conditions or land-use patterns), and compliance (e.g., types and levels of compliance). Weâ€™d like to know about any contextual data that are gathered as part of this project.</p>
