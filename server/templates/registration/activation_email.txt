Thank you for your interest in the Point 97 Demo. 

When you signed up:
1.  We created an account for you using the username and password you provided.
2.  We automatically logged you in to the Demo dashboard in a new browser window.
3.  We sent you this email with links to the survey examples.

Next Steps:

Outside this demo, our Point 97 tool is used around the world to collect information in a wide range of scenarios.  Compressing all these possibilities into an easy-to-envision demo means we had to trim some corners.  If you’d like to learn more about those corners, please let us know at info@pointnineseven.com!  

In the meantime, here’s a simple path to follow:

Take the survey:  To visualize mobile collection, open this email on your smartphone and click any of the survey links below.  You can answer one or both as many times as you’d like.

Visualize your collected information:  When you’ve completed the questionnaire(s), return to a larger screen (e.g., on a laptop or tablet) and either visit the browser window we’ve already opened for you or log in at http://demo.pointnineseven.com/dash/.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please let us know at info@pointnineseven.com.  We’d love to hear from you!

Sincerely,

The Point 97 Team
